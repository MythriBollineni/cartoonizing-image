# cartoonizing-image
Built a Python project using OpenCV to convert real-world images into cartoon-like illustrations. It combines edge detection, median blur, adaptive thresholding, and bilateral filtering to produce smooth, vibrant visuals that mimic hand-drawn cartoons with clear, sharp edges and simplified colors.
